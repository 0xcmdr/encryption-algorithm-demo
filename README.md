# An Image Encryption Algorithm Based on Chaotic Selection of Robust Cryptographic Primitives
## Introduction
This project involves the implementation of an encryption algorithm. The main purpose of the encryption algorithm is image encryption, but it can be successfully encrypted in the text with the same algorithm.

In order to provide easy understanding of the encryption algorithm, the algorithm has been designed to be tested on a website.
Within the scope of the project, the S-Box structures of the AES algorithm and DES algorithm are used in addition to the SHA3 algorithm.
* For more details, you can review the [IEEE Page](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9044816)

## Getting Started
>If you just want to look at the algorithm codes, you can examine the lib folder.
### Prerequisites
* The project was created using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). 
* A NodeJS and NPM must be installed on your local computer to start the project.


Example Installation for Ubuntu and Debian.
```bash
# Using Ubuntu
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_13.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Using Debian, as root
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_13.x | bash -
apt-get install -y nodejs
```
If you are using other platforms, you can use this link. [NodeJS Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
### Installing
Install the dependencies.
```bash
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/0xcmdr/encryption-algorithm-demo.git

# Install required node modules
$ yarn install

# OR 
$ npm install
```

## Deployment

Initalize Project Fils and Launch Development Server
```bash
$ yarn dev

# OR

$ npm run dev
```
> After this process, you can access the website via http://localhost:3000
## Built With
